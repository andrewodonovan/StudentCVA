>HOBBIES AND INTERESTS:
Involved with the Cork/Kerry Showjumping branch for the past six years setting up and running the digital timing systems at every show in the region.
This year I also joined the Showjumping Ireland Judges Panel and I’m now one of the youngest Showjumping Judges in the country.
I judge and commentate regularly at Maryville Stables Equestrian Centre and various local Gymkhana events.
I have a keen interest in Information Technology completing various home automation projects as well as projects using my Raspberry Pi.
Class Representative for my BIS 2 Class.
This involved a lot of organising and problem solving as well as excellent communication skills to act as intermediary between the students and department members to voice any concerns facing the student body.
